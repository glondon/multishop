Php-MultiShop 0.8, based on PHP-Nuke version 7.8 (with patch 3.1) and osCommerce Milestone 2.2
==============================================================================================

Welcome to Php-MutiShop!

Php-MultiShop is a CMS & e-Commerce System, an OpenSource platform 
to realize a virtual mall that includes various shops and contents.
The user will have a global vision of the portal, to read the most 
interesting content (news, forums, curiosities, suggestions, reviews, 
cultural or commercial events, fairs, recipes, tourist itineraries,...) 
and to have the possibility to visit the shop that prefers. 

Every shop will have all the functionalities and the personalizations 
of a traditional e-commerce web-site, as if it were independent from 
the virtual mall. It will have the own internet domain and could be 
administrated in full autonomy by the own administrator.
At the same time, it could be distinct from the mall and other shops 
thanks to the personalized graphic, the own style, organization, 
contents and products, as well as every shop into a real market place.
Besides, being part of a large place able to attract different typologies 
of visitors and consumers, it will be visible and easily attainable, 
increasing the own audience and potential market. 

Php-MultiShop is written in PHP, run on Apache webserver and MySQL 
database server, is able to run on any environment PHP and MySQL, 
including Linux, Solaris, BSD, Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows environments. 
To realize the portal is used the popular CMS PhpNuke, and for every shop 
the efficient suite e-commerce osCommerce.
