==============================================================================================
Php-MultiShop 0.8, based on PHP-Nuke version 7.8 (with patch 3.1) and osCommerce Milestone 2.2
==============================================================================================

=================
FULL INSTALLATION
=================
Php-MultiShop is Free Software to build a Virtual Mall:
a Web Marketplace in which there are two components:
- the 'portal-side': a Content Management System based on PhpNuke,
  in other words, the central and required component of the platform,
- the 'store-side': it's the e-commerce component, based on osCommerce,
  to build one store (or many independent stores).
The first and required component is the portal-side.
After, if you want to do e-commerce, you can install the store-side.
Departing from the package you can make a full installation
(first the portal-side, after the store-side) or,
if already you have a PhpNuke portal installed on your server, you can install
Php-MultiShop as Add-on of your portal.
In facts, Php-MultiShop works as Add-on on PhpNuke.

Some details:
the DB of the platform is one, the same for the CMS and the stores,
with the following structure:
- the portal tables names start with a 'portal-prefix' (for example, the default is 'nuke')
- the table names of every store start with the 'store-prefix' (e.g.: shop1, shop2, bookshop, jewellershop,...)
- other tables without 'prefix' are shared among the portal and the stores.


-------------------
PORTAL INSTALLATION
-------------------
The first step is the installation of the portal ('portal/' folder).
Copy the content of 'portal/' folder where you want, for example:

	mkdir /var/www/your-portal-dir
	cp -R Php-MultiShop/portal/*   /var/www/your-portal-dir/
	
There are 2 ways to install the portal: 

a) through the web installer interface: go to the 'install' folder via web and follow the instructions
	http://your-webportal.com/install/
or

b) manually: read the file docs/portal/INSTALL.

If you already have installed a PHPNuke portal, read the
file 'Multishop_as_Addon/README.txt'


------------------
STORE INSTALLATION
------------------
After the installation of the portal, you can install a shop through the 'store/' folder:
copy the content of the 'store/' folder on yopur server, where you want, 
for example in /var/www/your-portal-dir/shop1:
	
	mkdir /var/www/your-portal-dir/shop1
	cp -R Php-MultiShop/store/*   /var/www/your-portal-dir/shop1/

Then, through a browser, go to the web installer interface at the 'install' directory
and follow the instructions:
	
	http://your-webportal.com/shop1/install

After the installation and configuration of your store, when a minimum quantity
of content (as products, ...) is available, you can add (to link) the store to 
the portal:
go to the portal Administration Panel, in the Multi-Shop admin module,
click on Shops/Stores, then add your new store.
The Url for this operation is:
	http://your-webportal.com/admin.php?op=shops
when 'admin.php' is your admin file, that you can rename for security reason,
edit the config.php file.
After adding the new store, you should set some preferences and add further information
by editing this store (click on 'edit' link).

Note: in the Multi-Shop module there is a guide online to explain how to manage this module.


----------------------------
INSTALLATION OF OTHER STORES
----------------------------
If you want to install other store(s), simply repeat the 'STORE INSTALLATION'
but in other folder on your server, for example in '/var/www/your-portal-dir/shop2/':

	mkdir /var/www/your-portal-dir/shop2
	cp -R Php-MultiShop/store/*   /var/www/your-portal-dir/shop2/


====================
FOR EXISTING PHPNUKE
====================
If you already have an PhpNuke portal and you want to install Php-MultiShop as Add-on, 
read the file 'Multishop_as_Addon/README.txt'
