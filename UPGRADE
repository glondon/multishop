=====================
Php-MultiShop Upgrade
=====================

# 1. Backup
First all, is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED a backup of your DataBase and FileSystem.
Important: save your existing config.php file, for example:
	
	cp config.php config.php.old


# 2. Upgrade the PhpNuke DataBase
To upgrade from previous PHP-Nuke versions,
Select the correct upgrade-file from the 'upgrades-phpnuke/' folder.
For example, to upgrade PHPNuke from 7.6 to 7.8 version, select the two files:
	
	upgrades-phpnuke/7.x/upgrade76-77.php
	upgrades-phpnuke/7.x/upgrade77-78.php

then, copy and run these files on your server:

	http://your-webportal.com/upgrade76-77.php
	
	http://your-webportal.com/upgrade77-78.php
	
after, delete these files from your server.


# 3. Upgrade the Php-MultiShop DataBase
After the upgrade of PHPNuke, you must use the files included
in 'Multishop_Upgrade/' folder to upgrade the Php-MultiShop DataBase.
Go in 'Multishop_Upgrade/' folder, select the correct upgrade-file;
copy and run this file on your sever.

For example, to upgrade Php-MultiShop from 0.7 to 0.8 version, select the file:
	
	Multishop_Upgrade/multishop_upgrade07-08.php

Copy and run this file on your server:

	http://your-webportal.com/multishop_upgrade07-08.php

after, delete this file from your server.


# 4. Upload the new package
Copy the old configuration (from the file config.php.old created at step #1)
to the config.php file of the new package.

COPY ALL THE CONTENT of 'portal/' folder on your server,
without the 'portal/install' directory.

IMPORTANT: remember to REMOVE the 'portal/install' directory.

IMPORTANT NOTE:
probably, some variables/constants of the old config.php file are missing in the new file:
don't worry, it's right.

IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT CURRENCIES
after upgraqde, remember to check your currencies through the new function "CURRENCIES"
in the Multi-Shop admin module, then update the data if necessary
(for example, set the default currency).


# 5. If, after a brief testing, your portal works correctly,
remove the file config.php.old


# 6. ONLY from version 0.5 of php-multishop:
delete the following (obsolete) files:

 Nuke/html/admin/case/case.multishop.php
 Nuke/html/admin/links/links.multishop.php
 Nuke/html/admin/modules/multishop.php
 
 Nuke/html/modules/Privacy (all)
 Nuke/html/modules/Vendors (all)

(note: since php-multishop version 0.6, the modules and the files above
 has been replaced by the Multishop module)


# 7. ONLY from version 0.5 of php-multishop:
update of stores setting
For every shop you must put the favourite setting:
after the upgrade as default your shops not are allowed to show "Products", "Reviews",
"Products Specials" and "Product Best" in the Nuke platform,
then you can change these setting as you want with the admin module Multi-Shop.
Go to:

	http://your-webportal.com/admin.php?op=multishop

then change the shops clicking on the respective "Edit" option.
Also, the shop can be classified in "active", "external" and "inactive".
  - active: shops with all the features, installed in the same server and DB of Phpnuke.
  - external: shop installed in other DB or server; for these shops the users (customers) cannot keep the log-in.
  - inactive: for any other shop (in progress, deactivated, waiting payment, ...);
    in every blocks and modules of the phpnuke portal the shops set as "inactive"
    will be not included, then not visible to the users/customers.
Then, as the upgrade process set as default any shop as "active",
you can change this setting.


It's all...
