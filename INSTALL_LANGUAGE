How to install a Language.
----------------------------

----
Note
----
This is a brief guide to install a new language in MultiShop platform,
but only in the PhpNuke portal, not in every shop.
For the language in every shop (osCommerce), please visit the site
http://www.oscommerce.org to download the language-pakage and to read the documentation.


------------
Instructions
------------
As default, the platform have 5 languages:
1 - english
2 - german
3 - spanish
4 - italian
5 - french
To install a new language (for example: 6 - russian), we have to change two tables
in the DB, set a new variable in "Nuke/html/config.php" file, and after we can 
copy every file of the package-translation, in every directory.


1) Change the table nuke_categories_products:
you must add the field `name_russian` in `nuke_categories_products`:
`name_english` varchar(32) NOT NULL default ''
For this operation we can use some Tool, as phpMyAdmin, or use directly the
mysql command line below:

ALTER TABLE nuke_categories_products ADD COLUMN name_russian varchar(32) NOT NULL default '';


2) Change the table nuke_vendors_details:
you must add two fields.
`shop_russian` text,
`prod_russian` text,

and the command line is:

ALTER TABLE nuke_vendors_details ADD COLUMN shop_russian text;
ALTER TABLE nuke_vendors_details ADD COLUMN prod_russian text;


3) Change the table nuke_content_static:

ALTER TABLE nuke_content_static ADD COLUMN content_russian text;


4) Now, you must asdd/set some variables in the file "config.php":
add the new variable, for example:

$lang_id['russian'] = 6;
...
Note:
if you want to use only a language, for example spanish, you can delete every 
variable language, then leave: $lang_id['spanish'] = 1;


4) Copy the files of the package-translation, in every directory,
for ex. for PhpNuke:

Nuke/html/admin/language/lang-russian.php
Nuke/html/includes/oscommerce/languages/russian.php
Nuke/html/language/lang-russian.php
Nuke/html/modules/Categories_Products/language/lang-russian.php
Nuke/html/modules/Multishop/language/lang-russian.php
Nuke/html/modules/Your_Account/language/lang-russian.php

and the languages-files for every shop (store-side, based on osCommerce)

5) Note: you can see the products in a language on the MultiShop platform,  
only if there are the products descriptions in this language in the shops  
with the same language_id
(check, for every shop, this language_id in the table "PREFIXSHOP_products_description").
